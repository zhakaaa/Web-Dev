<!--A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available-->
<!--An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary-->
<!--The <div> element is a block-level element and is often used as a container for other HTML elements -->
<!--The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document-->
